Lyrics to the Christmas carol “The Twelve Days of Christmas”:

On the first day of Christmas,
My true love sent me
A partridge in a pear tree.

On the second day of Christmas,
My true love sent me
Two turtle doves,
A partridge in a pear tree.

On the third day of Christmas,
My true love sent me
Three french hens,
Two turtle doves,
A partridge in a pear tree.

On the fourth day of Christmas,
My true love sent me
Four calling birds,
Three french hens,
Two turtle doves,
A partridge in a pear tree.

On the fifth day of Christmas,
My true love sent me
Five gold rings,
Four calling birds,
Three french hens,
Two turtle doves,
A partridge in a pear tree.

On the sixth day of Christmas,
My true love sent me
Six geese a-laying,
Five gold rings,
Four calling birds,
Three french hens,
Two turtle doves,
A partridge in a pear tree.

On the seventh day of Christmas,
My true love sent me
Seven swans a-swimming,
Six geese a-laying,
Five gold rings,
Four calling birds,
Three french hens,
Two turtle doves,
A partridge in a pear tree.

On the eighth day of Christmas,
My true love sent me
Eight maids a-milking,
Seven swans a-swimming,
Six geese a-laying,
Five gold rings,
Four calling birds,
Three french hens,
Two turtle doves,
A partridge in a pear tree.

On the ninth day of Christmas,
My true love sent me
Nine ladies dancing,
Eight maids a-milking,
Seven swans a-swimming,
Six geese a-laying,
Five gold rings,
Four calling birds,
Three french hens,
Two turtle doves,
A partridge in a pear tree.

On the tenth day of Christmas,
My true love sent me
Ten lords a-leaping,
Nine ladies dancing,
Eight maids a-milking,
Seven swans a-swimming,
Six geese a-laying,
Five gold rings,
Four calling birds,
Three french hens,
Two turtle doves,
A partridge in a pear tree.

On the eleventh day of Christmas,
My true love sent me
Eleven pipers piping,
Ten lords a-leaping,
Nine ladies dancing,
Eight maids a-milking,
Seven swans a-swimming,
Six geese a-laying,
Five gold rings,
Four calling birds,
Three french hens,
Two turtle doves,
A partridge in a pear tree.

On the twelfth day of Christmas,
My true love sent me
Twelve drummers drumming,
Eleven pipers piping,
Ten lords a-leaping,
Nine ladies dancing,
Eight maids a-milking,
Seven swans a-swimming,
Six geese a-laying,
Five gold rings,
Four calling birds,
Three french hens,
Two turtle doves,
A partridge in a pear tree.
